code for chess network analysis


chess-v1.py takes a pgn titled 'chessdata.pgn' and processes the game info, skipping over information related to individual game moves. 
This runs significantly faster than packages that process game data. 

To use: 
Save pgn format game data as 'chessdata.pgn'.
Run chess-v1.py.
Output will be a csv titled 'chess-data.csv' saved to the working directory. 

Many other files in repository were for rudimentary testing. 
Not all testing files were written by me, but by classmates, hence the inconsistency in coding style.
